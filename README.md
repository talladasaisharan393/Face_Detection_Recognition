# Face Detection and Recognition Model

## Overview
This project implements a face detection and recognition system using OpenCV and machine learning. The system detects faces in images and recognizes them using a trained model.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Libraries**
   - Install necessary libraries given in txt file.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Open the `Face_Detection_Recognition.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
   - Run the notebook cells to execute the face detection and recognition tasks.

## Dataset
The **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)** dataset is used for this project. It will be automatically downloaded when the notebook is run.

## Code Structure
- `Face_Detection_Recognition.ipynb`: Contains code for face detection and recognition.
- `libraries required.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file with setup and usage instructions.

## Results
The system provides face detection and recognition accuracy metrics. The example output is displayed as a classification report.

## Optimization
Basic optimizations, such as PCA for dimensionality reduction and SVC for classification, have been applied.
